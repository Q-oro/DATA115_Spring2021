## Motivation: 

My motivation to explore the stocks that were being pushed in the subreddit, r/wallstreetbets, was the thought of how, with minimal information, could I invest into these stocks and come out with a gain. I wanted to learn more about investing so I could make more money. With investing into stocks and cryptocurrencies becoming more main stream, this has allowed anyone to become an investor themselves. The question I wanted to explore with this project was "Out of GME, AMC, and Dogecoin, if you had bought in at the beginning of the year of 2021, which would have been the best stock to invest in if you were holding?"

## Data Source: 

The data for the stocks I explored was gathered from Yahoo! Finance through looking up the stocks and going to the historical data tab. From there, you can choose from daily, weekly, and monthly information of data for each stock you are looking at with specified dates as well. 

## Data Process: 

When gathering the data for GameStop, AMC Entertainment, and Dogecoin from Yahoo Finance, it provided the date, open price, closing price, highest/lowest price, adjusted closing price, and volume. In general, the data was already exceptionally clean and easy to use. I was very lucky that there was already a date function in Yahoo Finance when extracting the data for the stocks and cryptocurrency. This allowed me to not have to delete any rows on my own. I did make sure that there were no nulls or empty rows/columns in data I pulled. When figuring the dates to look at specifically, I stuck with exploring the dates between 1/1/2021 and 4/23/2021 (last Friday before the due date of the project)

## Visualization: 

Below are the visualization I gathered from the data:

Each graph shows an overall gain if you had held since your initial investment from January 1st, 2021.

For both AMC and GME stocks, we do see more movement in the stock because there were a high volume going in and out of the market. 
We also see a huge jump in the stock price in end of January and early February because of the pump that came with the collective efforts of the subreddit, 
r/wallstreetbets. This was amazing to watch and what made me want to learn more about investment initially.

Dogecoin was the focus of investors after the whole r/wallstreetbets pump of stocks they chose. It is amazing to see how well a cryptocurrency that was made out of 
meme is doing right now. 

## Analysis:

With the little knowledge I knew, I assumed that stocks were going to be the most solid gains of returns compared to the young cryptocurrency. 
Below are the tables showing the initial purchase price and selling price of GME, AMC and Dogecoin as a new investor with the dates. 
The table allows you to see that all three prices rose allowing anyone who had invested to make a good amount of return. 

<table>
<tr><th> GME </th><th> AMC </th><th> DOGECOIN </th></tr>
<tr><td>
  
|                | Date       | Price   |
| -------------- | --------   | ------- | 
| Purchase Price | 1/4/2021   |	$19.00  | 
| Selling Price  | 4/23/2021	 | $149.00	| 

</td><td>
  
|                | Date       | Price  |

| Selling Price  | 4/23/2021	| $10.09 |

| Selling Price  | 4/23/2021	| $0.2610	|

Utilizing the formula for how much profit could have been made in each of the three stocks we examined, 
we do this, (Sell Price - Purchase Price)/Purchase Price x 100. This provided us with a percentage of gain from either three.

## Conclusion: 

Stocks and Cryptocurrency is the newest trend that everyone from the kid down the street is doing. Is it easy? No. Did I learn a lot from this? I did, but I realized that each time I learned more, I had more questions come up about the stock. Overall examining the data, there are no outliers in stock prices essentially because the volatility of stocks is high. This project made me realize how amazing data analysis can be used to your advantage and help figure things out with the data you gathered. I feel when continuing with the project after the class, I will examine other stocks I may want to invest in and see how the trend of the investment looks. In the end, the best investment between the three would have been Dogecoin. Will it stay that way? I am not sure. It seems with stocks and cryptocurrencies, there will be always be ups and downs. Are they huge loses or huge gains? It really depends on if you are long term holders or more of a short term. There is a varity of investors and for me, the knowledge that is out there is exciting and I am happy to continue to learn to help myself be a safe investor.
